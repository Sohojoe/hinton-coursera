Repo for working through Geoffrey Hinton's Neural Network course (https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001)

% assignment2 — created write toy function….
% use write to have the NN continue to try and create text.
% note; after a new sentence(. or ?) it selects a word and random and continues.
% note: allDataModelRatedot1Epochs10 was trained using all the data (train, validate, test) to give a better model; not sure if it makes any difference - use train_data2 to use this approach (off by default)

% example
write('and', 'war', 'is', allDataModelRatedot1Epochs10, 100);
and war is all these people want to do that's the way.
into the end there.
week ago and you know that's the way to be.
would be the right now.
about old days may be.
but there is much more than the government.
